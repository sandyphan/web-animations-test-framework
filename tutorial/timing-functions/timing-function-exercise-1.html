  <p class="description">It's boring to see animations moving at one speed
   and to see animations to start and stop in a sudden which is not smooth
    at all. Now we know that there are several easing effects, let's try
     one in this exercise.</p>

  <p class="description">In this exercise, create an animation that moves
   300px from left and has ease-in-out effect applied to it for 5 seconds.</p>

  <div id="hideLabel" onclick="toggleSolution()">Show Solution</div>
  <div id="toggleText" class="codeSamples">
    <code>new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), {left: "300px"}, 
      {duration: 5, timingFunction: new TimingFunction("ease-in-out")});</code>
