  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 2 - Stepping through</div>

  <p class="description">You now know how to ease your animations. 
    Now let's do some stepping.</p>

  <p class="description">Basically how stepping works is it divides 
    the input time into a specified number of intervals that are equal 
    in duration. The output time, starting at zero, rises by an amount 
    equal to the interval duration once during each interval at the 
    transition points. (where input time is the raw duration of the 
    animation and output time is the manipulated time duration, though 
    both duration should be the same but the effects are different)</p>

  <p class="description">Now let's divide an animation that moves down 
    400px from top for 3 seconds into 3 steps to see what happen. The 
    values should change in the middle of the animation.</p>

  <p class="description">Don't forget that the function for stepping 
    requires 2 parameters: the number of steps and the position where 
    value changes</p>
