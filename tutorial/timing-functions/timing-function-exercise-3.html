  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 3 - More Easing (Challenge)</div>

  <p class="description">Easing with presets string are easy, but a bit 
    boring. What if you want to set your own timing so that it go fast and
     slow at certain point of time according to your likings? Well, to 
     something I did not mention at the beginning of this section, is, 
     for timing functions, you can set your own values by inputing values
      in the range [0,1]. Note that the number does not have to be in order.
    </p>

  <p class="description">You could have done something like this:</p>

  <code class="codeSamples">new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), 
    {top: "400px"}, {duration: 5, timingFunction: new 
    TimingFunction([0, 0,2, 0.8, 1])});</code>

  <p class="description">OR</p>

  <code class="codeSamples">new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), 
    {top: "400px"}, {duration: 5, timingFunction: 
    new TimingFunction([0, 1, 0.1, 1])});</code>

  <p class="description">You can try the above codes in the editor below 
    to see what they do. Though for this exercise, make an animation that 
    runs very slowly at the beginning then ends really fast. The animation
     should move for 5 seconds 300px from left. In this exercise the lowest
      value above 0 would be 0.1 and highest would be 1.</p>
