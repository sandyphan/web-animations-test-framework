  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 3 - Square (Challenge)</div>

  <p class="description">You have basically know all the things about 
    parallel animation groups so let's get yourself prepared for 
    some challenges.</p>

  <ul class="description">
    <li>In this exercise, you need to create an animation with the 
      following requirements:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Move 300px from left, colour changes from red to blue.</li>
        <li>Then move 400px from top, colour changes from blue to yellow.</li>
        <li>Then move 300px form right, colour changes from 
          yellow to green.</li>
        <li>Then move 400px from bottom, colour changes from green to red.</li>
        <li>The animation should have ease-in effects as well as 
          repeating itself 2 times.</li>
        <li>The total duration of animation is 5 seconds.</li>
      </ol>
  </ul>

  <div id="toggleText" class="codeSamples">
    <code>var group = new ParGroup([], {iterationCount: 2, 
      timingFunction: new TimingFunction("ease-in")}); <br />
          new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), 
          {left: "300px"}, 5.0, group); <br />
          new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), 
          {top: "400px"}, {duration: 5.0, startDelay: 5}, group); <br />
          new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), 
          {left: "0px"}, {duration: 5.0, startDelay: 10}, group); <br />
          new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"),

          ["red", "blue", "yellow", "green", "red"]}, 20, group);
