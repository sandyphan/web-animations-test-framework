  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 2 - Parent in Children</div>

  <p class="description">Beside including children into the the parallel 
    group, there is another way to have children running parent's 
    timing properties.</p>

  <p class="description">Firstly, you create a parallel group with no 
    children in it (as child property is nullable) and only add the timing 
    properties you need into the group. Then for each children you make, 
    you add the parent into the child instead of timing properties:</p>

  <code class="codeSamples">var group = new ParGroup([], {duration: 2, 
    iterationCount: 2}); <br />
                            new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), 
                            {left: "100px"}, 2, group);
  </code>

  <p class="description">OR</p>

  <code class="codeSamples">new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), 
    {left: "100px"}, 2, new ParGroup([], {iterationCount: 2}));</code>

  <p class="description">For this exercise, make an animation that moves down 
    500px from top and changes colour from red to green then back to red in 5 
    seconds using parallel groups and iterates for 2 times.</p>

  <div id="hideLabel" onclick="toggleSolution()">Show Solution</div>
  <div id="toggleText" class="codeSamples">
    <code>
          new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), {top: "500px"}, 5, 
          new ParGroup([], {duration: 5, iterationCount: 2})); <br />
          new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), {"background-color": 
          ["red", "green", "red"]}, 5.0, new ParGroup([], 
          {duration: 5, iterationCount: 2}));
    </code>
