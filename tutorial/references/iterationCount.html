    <p class="description"><span class="keywords">iterationCount</span> 
    is of type <span class="datatype">unrestricted double</span>.</p>

    <p class='description'>A real number greater than or equal to zero 
    (including positive infinity) representing the number of times to 
    repeat the timed item.</p>

    <p class="description">For instance, a value of 2 would repeat 2 times 
    and a value of 2.5 would repeat for 2 times and a half, hence the 
    timed item will repeat 2 times and ends half-way through it's duration.</p>

    <p class="description">It has the following exeptions:</p>

    <ul class="description">
      <li>DOMException of type IndexSizeError</li>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>Raised on setting if the value to set is a real number 
          less than zero.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
