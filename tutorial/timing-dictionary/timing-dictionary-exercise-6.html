  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 6 - Directions</div>

  <p class="description">Let's play with some other things, directions. 
    As mentioned, we have 4 different directions: 'normal', 'reverse', 
    'alternate', 'alternate-reverse'. Easy to understand? So 'normal' is
     just proceeding in the normal direction which is left to right or 
     top to bottom. 'Reverse' is the opposite of 'normal', i.e. right to
      left, bottom to top. Sounds legit? Then 'alternate' is to move in 
      normal direction then back in reverse direction, so as for 
      'reverse-alternate' would be the opposite of 'alternate'.</p>

  <p class="description">You should be aware that 'alternate' and 
    'alternate-reverse' are only apparent to animations with iterationCount
     2+ (i.e. more than or equals to 2). So if you have iterationCount of 
     1 and has direction as 'alternate', then you will see the animation 
     moving in 'normal' direction and stop there, that goes the same for 
     'reverse-alternate'.</p>

  <p class="description">Let's start on the exercise, let the block moves 
    diagonally 300px from left and 300px from top in reverse-alternate 
    direction for 2 times.</p>

  <div id="hideLabel" onclick="toggleSolution()">Show Solution</div>
  <div id="toggleText" class="codeSamples">
    <code>new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), {left: "300px", 
      top: "300px"},  {iterationCount: 4, direction: 'alternate-reverse', 
      duration: 5});</code></div>
