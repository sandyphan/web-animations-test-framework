  <p class="description">Now you know how to create basic animations. 
    We can now try to add some more timing properties into the animation</p>

  <p class="description">The same as exercise 1, let's make the animation 
    move 300px from left and 400px from top diagonally. Then let the animation
     waits for 2 seconds before it will start. What property should 
     we use this time?</p>

     top: "400px"}, {startDelay: 2, duration: 5});</code>
