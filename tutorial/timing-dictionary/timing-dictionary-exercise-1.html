  <p class="description">Now you know how to create basic animations. 
    We can now try to add some more timing properties into the animation</p>

  <p class="description">Let's now make animation move 300px from left 
    and 400px from top (i.e. moving diagonally), and it will move for 5 
    seconds and will start after a 2 seconds into the animation.</p>

  <p class="description">Hint: use startTime</p>

      top: "400px"}, {startTime: 2, duration: 5});</code>
