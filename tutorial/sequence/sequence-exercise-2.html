  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 2 - Overlapping (Challenge)</div>

  <p class="description">Let's have some play around with start 
    delay in sequence groups.</p>

  <p class="description">In this exercise, create 3 different animations 
    using 3 different animation divs, make the first and second animation
    overlap by 2 seconds and make the third animation waits 2 seconds 
    after the first and second animation has finished running.</p>

  <ul class="description">
    <li>The first animation moves 400px from left</li>
    <li>Start position of the second animation div should be at 200px 
      from left</li>
    <li>Let the second animation move to 500px from left</li>
    <li>Let the third animation start at 100px from top</li>
    <li>The third animation should move to 300px from left</li>
    <li>All 3 animations should run for 5 seconds</li>
    <li>The whole cycle should be repeated twice.</li>
  </ul>
