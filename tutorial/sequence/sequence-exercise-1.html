  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 1 - Make a Sequential Group</div>

  <p class="description">Similar to parallel animation groups, there are 
    a few ways to include children into the sequential groups.</p>

  <p class="description">In this exercise, use the old method - first create 
    all necessary animations then include them into the group.</p>

  <p class="description">Create 3 animations that runs sequentially, the first 
    animation runs diagonally 300px from left and 300px from top, the second 
    animation runs diagonally 600px from left and 0px from top, then the third 
    animation moves back to the start position. Each animation should take 3 
    seconds to run.</p>

  <p class="description note">Note: this exercise should only need one 
    animation div, so do not make more divs. Do not add any start delay.</p>
