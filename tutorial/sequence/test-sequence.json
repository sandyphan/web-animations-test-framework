    "paragraph1": "Similar to parallel animation groups, there are a few ways to include children into the sequential groups.",
    "paragraph2": "In this exercise, use the old method - first create all necessary animations then include them into the group.",
    "paragraph3": "Create 3 animations that runs sequentially, the first animation runs diagonally 300px from left and 300px from top, the second animation runs diagonally 600px from left and 0px from top, then the third animation moves back to the start position. Each animation should take 3 seconds to run.",
    "note": "Note: this exercise should only need one animation div, so do not make more divs. Do not add any start delay."
