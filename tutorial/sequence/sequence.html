    <p class="description">Web animations is to have a flash or GIF 
      animation intergrated onto the web page. Normal web animations 
      still require the use of plugins such as Java Applets, Shockwave, 
      Adobe Flash. In this tutorial, we will be showing you how to create 
      animations using javascript without the need of installing plugins.</p>

    <div class="heading subTitle">Sequential Animation Groups</div>

    <p class="description">We have been through parallel animation groups, 
      it's time for us to do some sequential things. Just as the name 
      suggests, children in a sequential animation group runs sequentially
       even if they do not have a set delay time. (Though a negative start 
       delay can cause 2 children to overlap).</p>

    <p class="description">The interface for sequential animation group is:</p>

    <code class="codeSamples">new SeqGroup([children], 
      {timing/timing functions});</code>

    <p class="description">You can see that the interfaces are very similar,
     even the properties of the children and timing are the same as well. 
     That is, both children and timing are nullable but only timing is 
     optional.</p>

    <p class="description note">Note: for sequence groups, you have to 
      always manually set it to play, else it would not play automatically.
       Hence, the following sample is a more recommended one.</p>

    <code class="codeSamples">
      var seqGr = new SeqGroup([A, B]);
      seqGr.play();
    </code>

    <p class="description">Where A and B are individual animations. play() 
      is a method to let the animation runs. In order to pause the animation, 
      you can use pause().</p>
