  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 3 - More Challenges</div>

  <p class="description">Now you know how to use both parallel and sequential 
    animation groups. Let's get started on some harder exercises.</p>

  <p class="description">For this exercise, create 4 animations to 4 
  different items. Divide the animations evenly into 2 groups where 
  the first group contains the 1st and 2nd elements. The second group 
  should wait until the first group has finished running to run. The 
  elements of the first group should move 300px and 400px from left 
  respectively. The group should run for 3 seconds and repeat twice. 
  The second group should move 300px and 400px from left respectively 
  where the 2nd element in the group will have to wait half way to start. 
  That is each element should run for 4 seconds and the 2nd element will 
  wait for 2 seconds to run. The second group should also repeat itself 3 
  times. In addition, the first group will change colours from red to green 
  then back to red, the second group will change colours from blue to yellow 
  then to blue.</p>

  <ul class="description">
    <li>Create 4 animations.</li>
    <li>Create 2 groups, group the 1st and 2nd elements into the first 
    and the rest into the second.</li>
    <li>Animate the first group such that it repeats twice. Elements in 
    this group should run in parallel.</li>
    <li>Animate the second group such that one runs half way to anther and 
    repeats itself 3 times. Elements should run in sequence</li>
    <li>First group changes colour from red to green then to red.</li>
    <li>Second group changes colour from blue to yellow then to blue.</li>
  </ul>
