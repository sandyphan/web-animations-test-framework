  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 5 - Changing Colours</div>
  <p class="description">Now you have known a tonne of basics stuffs 
    about web aniamtions, how about let's try out changing the colour 
    of the block since red doesn't look as nice. The question is, how?</p>

  <p class="description">It is easy, we only need to access it's 
    background-color property and change it. Sounds easy enough? The 
    following code will change the block from red to green:</p>

  <code class="codeSamples">new Animation(document.querySelector("#a"), 
    {"background-color": ["red", "green"]}, 2);</code>

  <p class="description">So the above code had just access the 
    background-color property in CSS and change it from red to green. 
    You can always change them to other colours such as blue, grey, 
    yellow, or even #827031.</p>

  <p class="description">Now let's give it a try. Your task for this 
    exercise is to change the colour of the block from red to green, 
    then to light steel blue, then green then back to red again in 10 
    seconds.</p>

  <p class="description">Hint: you will only need one line of code so 
    don't write 3 lines of codes for changing 3 colours. You can actually 
    put 2+ colours in the square brackets.</p>
