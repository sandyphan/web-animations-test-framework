  <div class="heading subTitle">Create a new basic animation</div>

  <div class="heading exercises">Exercise 4 - Moving in rectangle 
    (challenge)</div>
  <p class="description">Now you know how to let the animation move 
    left, right, top and down as well as diagonally. How about you 
    try to let the move in a rectangle clockwise. So this is what 
    you need to achieve:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p class="description">Move right 400px</p></li>
    <li><p class="description">Move down 200px</p></li>
    <li><p class="description">Move left 400px</p></li>
    <li><p class="description">Then move back up 200px</p></li>
    <li><p class="description">Each move will take 2 seconds to run.</li>
  <ol>

  <p class="description">You may have to change the timing to 
    {startDelay: 2, duration: 2} from '2' at certain places. Note 
    that startDelay starts counting from the start of the animation.</p>

  <br />
